    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>DarkWall is committed to protecting your privacy. We collect only the minimal information necessary to provide you with the best wallpaper experience. This may include device information (such as device model, operating system, and app version), basic usage data (like which wallpapers are viewed or downloaded), analytics to help improve app performance, and crash reports to ensure app stability.</p>
    <p>If you choose to sign up or subscribe, we may collect your email address or account information, but we do not collect any personal information unless you voluntarily provide it.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>The information we collect is used solely to enhance your experience with DarkWall and to ensure the smooth functioning of the app. We use analytics data to understand which wallpapers are most popular, improve our content offerings, optimize app performance, and fix bugs.</p>
    <p>Your data is never sold, rented, or shared with third parties for their own marketing or advertising purposes.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to safeguard your information and protect it from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>DarkWall may use trusted third-party services (such as analytics providers or payment processors) solely to operate, analyze, and improve the app. These third-party providers have access only to the information necessary to perform their specific tasks on our behalf, and are required to protect your data according to their own privacy policies.</p>
    <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties for their own marketing or advertising. Your information is shared only with partners needed to provide DarkWall’s features, and never for unrelated marketing purposes.</p>

    <h2>Your Choices & Rights</h2>
    <p>You may choose not to provide certain information or may revoke device permissions at any time. If you have an account, you may request deletion of your information by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@darkwall.app">support@darkwall.app</a>.</p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>DarkWall is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child under 13 has provided us with personal data, please contact us to have it removed.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted in the app or on our website, and the “Last Updated” date will reflect the latest revision. Continued use of DarkWall after changes means you accept the updated policy.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or your data, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:support@darkwall.app">support@darkwall.app</a></p>
